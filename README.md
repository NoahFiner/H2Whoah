# H2Whoah Smart Irrigation Barrel
### What is this??
This is the back end framework for a smart stormwater irrigation barrel. This code helps analyze raw sensor measurements sent from a Particle Redboard and, using a weather API, return a result for how long a valve should open. Additionally, there will be a webapp using a Flask server to help plot sensor data and more.
